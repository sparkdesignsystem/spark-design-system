description:
    The Masthead is the first component on a page and includes navigation elements.
information:
  - There are three custom configurations that you must do in order for the Masthead's narrow navigation to work properly (see below restrictions).
  - The Masthead is "sticky" and content will flow under it.
  - All content used here is placeholder content. Please use your own logo, content, and hrefs.
  - Make sure you leave the 'data-sprk-masthead' attribute on the main Masthead element as it functions as a Spark JS hook. It's already included in the provided code.
restrictions:
  - You must configure the size of your own logo asset. If you don't then the logo will be automatically sized
    between the $masthead-logo-max-width (192px) and $masthead-logo-min-width (174px). You can additionally override those
    min and max settings by resetting those variables in your own SCSS file.
  - You must set (in your own SCSS file) the SCSS variable $mobile-masthead-height so that the navigation displays properly on small screens.
    To get the correct setting for your needs, put your logo in the Masthead and then grab the total height of the
    Masthead (on a narrow viewport) with your logo in it. Set
    $mobile-masthead-height to that height.
  - You must duplicate your navigational items in the Masthead navigation HTML and in the Masthead narrow
    navigation HTML. There are two chunks of markup for the Masthead, one for large viewports and one for small.
