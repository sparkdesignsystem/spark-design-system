<div class="sprk-u-mbm">
  <p>The Masthead component in spark-core-angular has several normal Inputs, seen below, as well as two 'slots'
  for use in specific use cases defined by the consuming app.</p>
  <ul class="drizzle-b-List drizzle-b-List--nested">
    <li><strong>upper-slot</strong> - <span>This is used for patterns in the top right of the masthead. Typically this is
      used for a search input.</span></li>
    <li><strong>lower-slot</strong> - <span>This is used for pattens in the lower right of the masthead. Typically used
      for a selector.</span></li>
    <li><strong>logo-slot</strong> - <span>This is used for the logo in the top left of the masthead. Typically used
      for a selector.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="sprk-u-mbm">The Masthead component makes use of the sprk-wide-navigation component and the
    sprk-narrow-navigaiton component. The 'links' input that those components expect should be supplied at
    the sprk-masthead level.</p>
