name: Tables
description: Tables are a set of columns and rows that lay out information.
  Use Tables for tabular data that is intended for comparison.
  If your data is only label value pairs, consider
  the <a class="drizzle-b-Link" href="https://sparkdesignsystem.com/patterns/components/dictionary">Dictionary</a> component instead.
information:
  - The Table patterns will squish the spacing to some degree, but will mostly preserve
    their width on narrow viewports.
  - Tables will become scrollable if the content overflows.
  - If your content does not fit well with this
    component on narrow viewports, you can switch to an
    alternate component.
restrictions:
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple 
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance 
    has a unique data-id property. ("table-primary-1", "table-primary-2", "table-secondary-1", etc)
