notes: |
  An Accordion is a simple way of showing, hiding and breaking down content.
  It helps to make content easier to find because it allows the content to be broken up.
info:
  Content length inside the accordion does not have a limit. Title content
  of the accordion can wrap, but it is recommended that it is short and to the point.
