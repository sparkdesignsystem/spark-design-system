  The Highlight Board component is used as a lead into an experience as a means to encourage engagement
  within the experience.
information:
  - The headline should grab attention and be concise.
  - To have the Highlight Board take up 100% width of the
    viewport regardless of it's container, add the class sprk-u-FullWidth to
    the highlight board. For React and Angular components, you can use the
    additionalClasses property.
restrictions:
  - The background must either be a color or an image.
  - The headline should not exceed 2 lines.
  - You may have up to 2 call-to-action buttons/links.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("highlightboard-1", "highlightboard-2", "highlightboard-3", etc).
