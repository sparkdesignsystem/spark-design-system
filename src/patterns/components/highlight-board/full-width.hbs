order: 4
description:
  The full width variation allows the background
  image of the Highlight Board to span the entire width of
  the viewport.
restrictions:
 - If an image is used in this variation,
   the image must have a wider aspect ratio.
   This will cause a zoom effect on narrow
   viewports, so you should use a responsive images solution to replace it.
