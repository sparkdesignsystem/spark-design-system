  sections of content. Hr HTML elements will
  have style by default so no additional CSS class is needed.

  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("divider-1", "divider-2", etc).
