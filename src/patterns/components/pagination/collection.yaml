  The Pagination component is comprised of a previous link, a next page link, and page number links.
  Use a Pagination component when you need a way to separate a large portion of content into smaller portions.
  It serves as navigation and informs users where they currently are and where they
  can go in the future.
information:
  - Spark-Core Pagination JS will take care of adding in the correct aria-label
    to each link on first page load and when the items are tapped or clicked.
