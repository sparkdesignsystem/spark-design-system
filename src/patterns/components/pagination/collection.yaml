notes: |
  Pagination provides a way to separate a large portion of content into smaller portions.
  It serves as navigation and informs users where they are currently and where they
  can go in the future.
restrictions:
  - The outer nav element with aria-label="Pagination Navigation" is required for user accessibility
  - Spark-Core Pagination JavaScript will take care of adding in the correct aria-label
    to each link on first page load and when the items are tapped or clicked to ensure accessibility
