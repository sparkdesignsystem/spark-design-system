description:
  Promos are groups of related promotional
  content that are meant to be displayed at full width. Use
  the Promo component when you would like to promote something new
  or existing. If necessary, you may add background colors, padding and/or a border.
information:
  - Promos use the Stack Layout Object and the items are stacked by default and will split side by side at larger viewports.
  - You may change the breakpoint at which the items split by adjusting the Stack split responsive suffix class.
  - Spark has built in spacing classes for padding that you can add to the container.
