  an easy way to get information quickly and are typically used in groups.

  - Cards use the Stack Layout Object.
  - The breakpoint when the Cards split horizontally can be changed by
    adjusting the Stack--split responsive suffix modifier.

  - Card images do not have a set width or height
    and need to have the same aspect ratio when there is more than one Card in a row.
