  Cards present related content. They provide
  an easy way to get information quickly and are typically used in groups.
information:
  - Cards use the Stack Layout Object.
  - The breakpoint when the Cards split horizontally can be changed by
    adjusting the Stack--split responsive suffix modifier.
restictions:
  - Card images do not have a set width or height
    and need to have the same aspect ratio when there is more than one Card in a row.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("card-1", "card-2", "card-3", etc).
