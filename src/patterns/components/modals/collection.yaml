notes: |
  Modals overtake the users screen forcing them to
  interact with it or to wait while the system performs an action in the background.
  The three different types of modals are Choice, Wait and Info.
info:
  - Spark JS will hook into the 'data-sprk-modal-trigger="<modalName>"' attribute to get the modal name and show that modal when the trigger is clicked.
  - Each modal container should have the attribute of 'data-sprk-modal="<modalName>"' if you want the simple trigger click event to show the modal.
  - Add 'data-sprk-modal-cancel="<modalName>"' to the cancel element inside the modal if you want it to close the modal
  - Omit the 'data-sprk-modal-trigger="<modalName>"', 'data-sprk-modal="<modalName>"' and 'data-sprk-modal-cancel="<modalName>"'
    attributes from the trigger, modal container and cancel element if you do not want
    to use the Spark JS.
  - If you wish to use your own modal JS you may import the modal utilities functions to utilize in your own code.
restrictions:
  - Modal HTML should be added right above the closing body tag.
  - Modals should be dismissible by tapping outside the modal, clicking cancel, or hitting the esc key.
  - Modals should trap focus when a user presses the Tab key or Shift+Tab inside the modal.
  - Modals should have the attribute of role="dialog".
  - When the modal is open we tell assistive devices that everything behind it is hidden by adding aria-hidden="true" on the document body.
  - If the content in the modal is too large for the viewport then the modal must show a scroll bar.
