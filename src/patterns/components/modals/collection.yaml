  The Modal component is a dialog box that is displayed on top of all site content. When a Modal is present,
  the rest of the site is inactive and covered by a mask. Use a Modal
  when you need the user to make a choice, or you need to present important information based on an action they took,
  or when you need to indicate something is happening. Modals are triggered by an action, usually, a form submit.
information:
  - When a Modal is open, the user can hit the "Escape" key, click the
    cancel element, the close icon, or click the outside mask to close the Modal (unless the Modal type is "Wait").
  - If you would like to use your own Modal JS instead of the Spark JS you should omit the
    required data attributes as seen in the code blocks below.
  - The Modal and mask elements are hidden by default.
  - If the content in the Modal is too large for the viewport then the Modal will show a scroll bar.
  - When the Modal is opened, the first focusable element inside the Modal will receive focus.
  - When the Modal is closed, focus will be returned to the Modal's trigger button.
  - When the Modal is open, focus is trapped inside the Modal when a user presses the Tab or Shift+Tab keys.
  - When the Modal is open we tell assistive devices that everything behind it is
    inactive by adding aria-hidden="true" on the main site container (data-sprk-main) and removing
    it once the Modal is closed.
restrictions:
  - Each Modal must have an unique identifier that is used for all data attributes
    related to that specific Modal. For example, data-sprk-modal="uniqueID" and data-sprk-modal-cancel="uniqueID".
  - Modal container HTML must be added right above the closing body tag and be outside of the main site content container.
  - The main content container of your site must have the attribute of 'data-sprk-main'.
  - The trigger element should always be outside the Modal container.
  - No more than one Modal should be open at a time.
  - Content length inside the Modal shouldn't exceed a reasonable
    amount.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("modal-choice-1", "modal-choice-2", "modal-info-1", etc).
