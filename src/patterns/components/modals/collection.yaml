  Modals are displayed over the top of all other content.
  There are three different UI types of modals, Choice, Wait and Info. Spark supplies JS to
  open and close modals that works when certain data attributes are added (identified below).
  Spark JS will also take care of the modal accessibility and keyboard events.
  If you would like to use your own modal JS instead of the Spark JS you should omit the
  required data attributes. You may also choose to use only certain Spark functions
  such as showModal() and hideModal() to utilize in your own code.
  There are two types of JS functionality that the three modal designs use.
  The two types are "default" and "Wait". The main difference between the two is
  the "Wait" modals do not allow the user to take an action that will close the modal whereas the default modal
  allows the user to hit a cancel element, press the "Escape" key, or click the modal background mask to
  close the modal. Each modal should have a trigger element that has
  the 'data-sprk-modal-trigger="<modalName>"' attribute. The trigger element should
  be outside the modal container and will open the modal when clicked or tapped.
restrictions:
  - Modal container HTML should be added right above the closing body tag and must be outside of the main site content area.
  - The main content area should have the attribute of 'data-sprk-main'.
  - Modals Must be dismissible by tapping outside the modal, clicking a cancel element, or hitting the Escape key (Spark JS provides this functionality).
  - Modals should trap focus inside the modal when a user presses the Tab or Shift+Tab keys inside the modal (Spark JS provides this functionality).
  - The container of the modal should have the attribute of role="dialog".
  - The modal and mask elements must have a tabindex="-1" to prevent them from receiving focus.
  - When the modal is open we must tell assistive devices that everything behind it is
    hidden by adding aria-hidden="true" on the main content container and removing it once modal is closed (Spark JS provides this functionality).
  - If the content in the modal is too large for the viewport then the modal must show a scroll bar (Spark SCSS provides this functionality).
  - When the modal is open we must capture the document's active element and return focus to this element
    once the modal is closed (Spark JS provides this functionality).
  - When the modal opens we must detect the number of focusable elements inside the modal and
    apply focus to the first one (Spark JS provides this functionality).
