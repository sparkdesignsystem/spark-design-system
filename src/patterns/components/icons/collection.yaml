description:
  Spark does not provide icons directly. What you see below are proprietary icons in use by Quicken Loans. To supply
  your own icon set, you need to import an svg that contains symbols for the ids referenced below. This symbol file
  should occur in the DOM before the first use element.
information:
  - The icon fill and stroke colors can be changed by setting the $icon-fill-color and $icon-stroke-color
    variables to something other than the default that Spark provides. Additionally, if
    you need to have the icon's fill/stroke use the color of its parent container you can apply the
    .sprk-c-Icon--current-color modifier to the icon.
restrictions:
 - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("icon-1", "icon-2", "icon-1", etc).
