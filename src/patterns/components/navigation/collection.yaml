description: These components represent the types of navigation available. Spark separates Secondary and Narrow Navigation patterns.
  We do this because we've found that in practice, a lot of elements need to be added to the narrow navigation and not to the
  Secondary navigation. For example, chat links, secondary navigation contents, legal links, etc.
restrictions:
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("navigation-narrow-1", "navigation-narrow-2", "navigation-wide-1", etc).
