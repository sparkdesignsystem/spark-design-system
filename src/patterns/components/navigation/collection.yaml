description: These components represent the types of navigation available. Spark separates Wide and Narrow Navigation patterns.
  We do this because we've found that in practice, a lot of elements need to be added to the narrow navigation and not to the
  wide navigation. For example, chat links, secondary navigation contents, legal links, etc.
