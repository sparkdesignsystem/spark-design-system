  Text links should take the user to a
  new place or change the view the user is on. Links use the medium
  blue brand color for their idle and hover states while using the dark blue brand color for the visited state.
restrictions:
  - Do not use Spark Link classes on links that solely have images in them.
  - Link text should be as meaningful as possible so users can understand what the purpose of the link is.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple instances of the same 
    variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance has a unique data-id property 
    ("link-1", "link-2", "link-3", etc).
