  Toggles have a clickable
  link and icon pair that show or hide a block of content.
  Use a Toggle when you need a simple way of showing, hiding and breaking down lengthy content.
  When the page loads, the Toggle icon and link are shown, but the content is hidden. When
  the icon or link are clicked the content will then be revealed.
information:
  - Toggles will look and function the same in all viewports.
  - Spark's Toggle JS will take care of initially adding and adjusting the aria-expanded HTML attribute based on
    if the content is hidden or visible.
  - You can adjust the spacing between the trigger link and the content by changing the
    spacing utility class on the content to a different size.
sparkPackageCore: true
restrictions:
  - Content that requires user interaction or consumption should
    not be housed within a Toggle.
  - If you need several Toggles in succession use the
    <a class="drizzle-b-Link" href="https://sparkdesignsystem.com/patterns/components/accordions">Accordion</a> component instead.
  - Overall sizing of the Toggle should be dependent on type size,
    but should remain large enough to be tappable on a mobile device
  - Content length inside the Toggle does not have a limit, but shouldn't exceed a reasonable
    amount.
  - The title of the Toggle doesn't have a specific maximum length and can wrap if needed.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("toggle-1", "toggle-2", "toggle-3", etc).
