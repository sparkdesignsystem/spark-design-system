notes: |
  Alert banners appear near the top of the page and are meant to provide the user
  with feedback based on completing an action or the lack of completion.
info:
  - May have timed visibility (10 seconds) and/or be dismissed by the user by clicking the "x" icon.
  - Should fill the width of the viewport.
  - The content should be kept short and concise.
  - If the content wraps to a new line the icon on the left should.
    remain vertically centered, but the dismiss icon should remain in place at the top right.
  - role="alert" is required so that assistive technology can inform users their attention is needed.
