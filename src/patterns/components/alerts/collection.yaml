description: An Alert is a way to notify users without interrupting their actions. Typically, Alerts are to appear
  at the top of the page. They consist of an icon (in either a success, info, or error state), an area for text, and
  an optional dismiss button.
information:
  - May have timed visibility (10 seconds) and/or be dismissed by the user by clicking the "x" icon.
  - If the content wraps to a new line the icon on the left should remain vertically centered, but the
    dismiss icon should remain in place at the top right.
restrictions:
  - Should fill the width of the viewport.
  - The content should be kept short and concise.
  - role="alert" is required so that assistive technology can inform users their attention is needed.
