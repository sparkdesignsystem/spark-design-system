    This is some text that a client needs to read because something failed or went wrong.
    There is extra text in here to demonstrate the icon placement when the message goes
    longer than one line. You will notice that the icon to the left stays vertically
    centered, but the dismiss icon remains in the top right corner. Alerts
    should never have this much text, though!
