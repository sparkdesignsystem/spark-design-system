information:
  - Special characters used in formatting (like the hyphens in the SSN field) are not automatically removed
    from the field value and may need to be manually removed depending on your implementation details.
  - You should use <a class="drizzle-b-Link" href="#helper-text">helper text</a> when a user needs further
    clarification beyond the field label.
restrictions:
  - You should always add the <code class='drizzle-c-Command drizzle-c-Command--inline'>novalidate</code> attribute
    to your form, since we handle form validation ourselves,
    and don't use the browser's implementation.
  - Make sure that each label's <code class='drizzle-c-Command drizzle-c-Command--inline'>for</code> attribute matches the
    <code class='drizzle-c-Command drizzle-c-Command--inline'>id</code> attribute of the corresponding input element.
  - Each input element's <code class='drizzle-c-Command drizzle-c-Command--inline'>id</code> should be unique on the page.
  - You need to make sure that the <code class='drizzle-c-Command drizzle-c-Command--inline'>id</code> referenced in
    <code class='drizzle-c-Command drizzle-c-Command--inline'>aria-describedby</code> matches the
    <code class='drizzle-c-Command drizzle-c-Command--inline'>id</code> on the error container.
  - You should use helper text, as linked below, when a user needs further clarification beyond the label.
  - Labels and error messages should be short and to the point.
  - Labels should not be longer than what will fit on one line at 320px.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple 
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance 
    has a unique data-id property ("input-text-1", "input-text-2", "input-date-1", etc).
