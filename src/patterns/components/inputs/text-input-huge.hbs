name: Text Input Huge
description:
  This text input is larger than base text input.
information:
  - The input's 'type' attribute should be the most appropriate value that semantically matches your
    use case.
  - The label is hidden, but important to include so it's still accessible to screen readers.
restrictions:
  - This should only be used in a form that asks for one input at a time.
