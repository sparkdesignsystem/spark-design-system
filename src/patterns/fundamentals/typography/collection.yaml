description: Typography means the style and size of text. Type settings here should be used in the
  construction of components not defined in Spark. See each setting for intended use.
information:
  - The heading elements are set automatically and don't require you to add classes.
  - The body copy will automatically get style and size from Spark, but in order to get the line height collision fix, you'll
    need to apply a setting class.
restrictions:
  - You must set up a Typekit kit for your application to make use of these settings.
