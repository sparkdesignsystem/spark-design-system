development environment. You can also check out [Part 2 - Installation](/installing-spark/html-installation) and

# Part 1: Setting up Your Environment for an HTML Project

For instructions on setting up Spark in other environments, check out the guides for
[Angular](/installing-spark/angular) and [React](/installing-spark/react) development environments.

Before you begin, make sure you <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">install Node Package Manager</a>
(`npm`).

This is a tool that makes it easy to share and reuse
JavaScript code and to update the JavaScript code you’re sharing.

Our <a href="https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/" target="_blank">starter app examples</a> are also available for reference:
- ['kitchen-sink' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/tree/kitchen-sink) (Spark Installed with component examples.)
- ['without-spark' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/tree/kitchen-sink) (All of the prerequisites before Spark Installation.)

## Create the Folder Structure

1. First you’ll need to make a new directory for your project, open it
and initialize `npm`.
``` shell
mkdir spark-html

cd spark-html

npm init
```

2. When prompted, accept the default settings for `npm init`. You
can always edit these later.
- Confirm that it's generated a `package.json`. This file keeps track
of all the dependencies that your site needs to build and run.

3. Inside your `spark-html` folder, create a `src` folder and a `dist` folder.

4. In the `src` folder, create a file called `index.js` and and add this code:
- A function that creates a div with text inside.
- Code that will add that div onto the page.

``` javascript
function component() {
  const element = document.createElement('div');
  element.innerHTML = 'Hello, Spark! JavaScript is working!';
  return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
```
> We do this because it's a way to check if we've hooked up our JavaScript correctly.

5. In the `dist` folder, create a file called `index.html` that will reference that `index.js` file inside the `<body>` tag.

``` html
<html>
  <head>
      <title>Hello, Spark!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You should now have the initial files for your new site. The folder
structure should look like this:

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={folderStructure}
    alt="A dist folder containing index.html. A src folder containing index.js. A package.json in the root."/>
</div>

6. Open `index.html` in a web browser. You should whatever text you set in your `index.js` file.

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={helloSpark}
    alt="Hello Spark!"/>
</div>

## Installing Webpack

<a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> combines all the JavaScript needed to run Spark into one file.

1. To install Webpack, run this command:

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

> The `--save-dev` flag indicates that these packages are required
to compile your website, but are not necessary to run the site
after compilation.

2. In your `package.json` file, look for
the `scripts` section. This is a list of custom commands that `npm`
can run. Add a new command for building the site
with Webpack:

``` json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
},
```

Webpack will combine all JavaScript into a single
file called `main.js`, so we'll need to reference that instead of `index.js`.

3. In `index.html` change the `<script>` that's using `index.js` to `main.js`.

``` html
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

10. Build your website.

``` shell
npm run build
```

You should now see a `main.js` file in your `dist` directory
containing minified JavaScript.

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={bundledJs}
    alt="Minified JSON in main.js"/>
</div>

## Installing Sass

<a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> is a tool that processes and compiles CSS. You'll need it to use Spark.

1. To install Sass, first run this command:

```
npm install node-sass sass-loader css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev
```

2. In the root directory of your project, create a new file called
`webpack.config.js` and paste this code into it:

``` javascript
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          'css-loader',
          'sass-loader',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'bundle.css'
    }),
  ],
};
```

3. Now let’s write some CSS to compile. Create a new file in `src`
called `style.scss` and copy this CSS into it:

``` css
body {
  background-color: green;
}
```

4. At the top of `index.js`, add this reference to the `scss`
file:

``` javascript
import "./style.scss"
```

Now when Webpack compiles `index.js`, this import line will include
your style file. It will be processed according to the rules
we set up in the webpack config in the previous step.

5. Add this reference to your new compiled CSS in the `<head>` element of `index.html`:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bundle.css"></link>
```

Now when you rebuild your site, you should see `bundle.css` in the
`dist` folder and your website should include your style:

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={greenBg}
    alt="Hello Spark on a green a background."/>
</div>
