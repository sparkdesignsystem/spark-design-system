# Installing Spark in an HTML Project
## Setting Up Your Environment

This guide is Part 1 in a 3-Part series and will walk through setting up your Spark
development environment. You can also check out [Part 2 - Installation](/installing-spark/html-installation) and
[Part 3 - Adding Components](/installing-spark/html-add-components).

For instructions on setting up Spark in other environments, check out the guides for
[Angular](/installing-spark/angular) and [React](/installing-spark/react) development environments.

Before you begin, make sure you <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">install Node Package Manager</a>
(`npm`). This is a tool that makes it easy to share and reuse
JavaScript code and to update the JavaScript code you’re sharing.

## Create the Folder Structure

1. First you’ll need to make a new directory for your project, open it
and initialize `npm`. You can do that with these UNIX commands:

``` shell
mkdir spark-html

cd spark-html

npm init
```

2. When prompted, accept the default settings for `npm init`. You
can always edit these later.

You should now have a `package.json` file created. This will keep track
of all the dependencies that your site needs to build and run.

3. Inside your `spark-html` folder, create a `src` folder and a `dist` folder.

4. In the `src` folder, create a file called `index.js` and copy this code into
it:

``` javascript
function component() {
  const element = document.createElement('div');
  element.innerHTML = 'Hello, Spark! JavaScript is working!';
  return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

5. In the `dist` folder, create a file called `index.html` and copy this code
into it:

``` html
<html>
  <head>
      <title>Hello, Spark!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You should now have the initial files for your new site. The folder
structure should look like this:

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={folderStructure}
    alt="A dist folder containing index.html. A src folder containing index.js. A package.json in the root."/>
</div>

6. Open `index.html` in a web browser. You should see this:

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={helloSpark}
    alt="Hello Spark!"/>
</div>

## Installing Webpack

<a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> is a tool that we’ll use to
combine all the JavaScript needed to run Spark into one file.

7. To install Webpack, run this command:

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

> The `--save-dev` flag indicates that these packages are required
to compile your website, but are not necessary to run the site
after compilation.

8. In your `package.json` file that you created in Step 2, look for
the `scripts` section. This is a list of custom commands that `npm`
can run against your package. Add a new one for building the site
with Webpack:

``` json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
},
```

Webpack will combine all JavaScript dependencies into a single
JavaScript file called `main.js`. This is the file that you want
your site to use.

9. Change the line in `index.html` where you set up the `<script>` 
tag to look like this:

``` html
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

10. Build your website by running this command:

``` shell
npm run build
```

You should now see a `main.js` file in your `dist` directory
containing minified JavaScript.

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={bundledJs}
    alt="Minified JSON in main.js"/>
</div>

## Installing Sass

Sass is a tool that processes and compiles CSS. You’ll need to use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>
to import Spark CSS from the npm package that you created in Step 2.

11. To install Sass, first run this command:

```
npm install node-sass sass-loader css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev
```

12. In the root directory of your project, create a new file called
`webpack.config.js` and paste this code into it:

``` javascript
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          'css-loader',
          'sass-loader',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'bundle.css'
    }),
  ],
};
```

13. Now let’s write some CSS to compile. Create a new file in `src`
called `style.scss` and copy this CSS into it:

``` css
body {
  background-color: green;
}
```

14. At the top of `index.js`, add this reference to the uncompiled `scss`
file:

``` javascript
import "./style.scss"
```

Now when Webpack compiles `index.js`, this import line will include
your style file. It will be processed according to the rules
we set up in the webpack config in the previous step.

15. Add this reference to your new compiled CSS in the `<head>` element of `index.html`:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bundle.css"></link>
```

Now when you rebuild your site, you should see `bundle.css` in the
`dist` folder and your website should include your style:

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={greenBg}
    alt="Hello Spark on a green a background."/>
</div>
