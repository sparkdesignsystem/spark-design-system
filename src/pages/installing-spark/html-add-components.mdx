# Part 3: Adding Spark Components in an HTML Project
This guide will cover how to add components for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Our <a href="https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/" target="_blank">Starter Github Repositories</a> are also available for reference:
- ['kitchen-sink' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/tree/kitchen-sink) (Spark Installed with component examples.)
- ['without-spark' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/tree/without-spark) (all of the prerequisites before Spark Installation.)

For instructions on setting up Spark in other environments, check out the
guides for [Angular](/installing-spark/angular) and [React](/installing-spark/react).

## Adding Your First Spark Component
Adding a Spinner Button can confirm you've installed Spark's Styles and JavaScript correctly.

This is just one example to implement functionality and get your project started.

1. Add Spark Button code into your `index.html` and include an `onclick` and a `data-id`.
``` html
  <button
    class="sprk-c-Button"
    data-id="button-spinner-1"
    onclick="startSpinner()"
  >
    Start Spinning
  </button>
```
> **Note**: Inside the `<body>` tag of `index.html`, the line `<script src="main.js"></script>` should be after
any other HTML elements.

2. In the `index.js` file, import `setSpinning` from Spark and create a `startSpinner` function (this is the function that will run `onclick`).
```javascript
import { setSpinning } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark';

window.startSpinner = () => {
  const spinningButton = document.querySelector('[data-id="button-spinner-1"]');
  setSpinning(spinningButton, {});
}
```

3. Build your app with `npm run build`, and you should find a Spark Button that loads a Spinner on click.

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={spinnergif}
    alt="A Spark Button Spinner component."/>
</div>

> Learn more about Buttons and Spinner functionality in the [Button Storybook documentation](https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--primary).

## Finding the code to other Spark Components

1. Go to the [Spark HTML Storybook](https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/)
2. Find the Component you need in the "Components" section.
3. Navigate to the *Docs* tab. It's typically at the top of screen next to *Canvas*.
4. Navigate down the page until you find your component variant.
5. The *Show code* button will toggle a code sample.

> These code samples represent the *rendered state*
after Spark's JavaScript functions run. Some functionality requires additional engineering.

The *Docs* section of each page will give implementation details for each component.
