# Setting Up Spark
## For Angular
This guide will walk you through
installing and using Spark on an
existing Angular application.
For help with setting up the
necessary development environment, see the
[Angular CLI Overview](https://angular.io/cli).

By the end of this, you’ll have all the
Spark JavaScript and CSS available
in your application to start
building components.

> Note: This covers setting up Spark for
Angular 6, 7 and 8. Spark doesn’t
currently support Angular JS.

Before you begin, make sure that:
 - You have a functioning Angular app similar
to the one in the [Angular CLI Overview](https://angular.io/cli)
- Sass is installed and functioning
- Angular Routing is installed
(not required by Angular CLI, but it is required for Spark)

## Installing Spark Packages

1. Start by going to your project
directory and install `spark` and `spark-angular`
 by pasting the following line in a command line application.

``` bash
npm install -save-dev @sparkdesignsystem/spark @sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular
```

2. Edit `app.module.ts` to import the `spark-angular` library
as also the `BrowserAnimationsModule`, and include
them in `@NgModule`'s `imports` array. This file can be
found in `your-app/src/app`.

``` typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { SparkAngularModule } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],

  imports: [
    SparkAngularModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],

  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

export class AppModule { }
```

3. Next, edit `styles.scss` to `@import` the Spark
stylesheet. This file can be found in `you-app/src`.

``` scss
@import "node_modules/@sparkdesignsystem/spark/spark.scss"
```

> Note: Importing Spark SCSS at the component level can lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Back on the command line, build
and run your new application by running
`npm run start` and opening `http://localhost:4200/`
in your web browser. When Angular builds,
Spark’s styles will be processed and
bundled into the application.

You can verify that Spark’s
styles are being included by
opening your browser’s developer
tools and inspecting the DOM.
There should be a `<style>`
tag in the `<head>` that includes
Spark’s styles.

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    src={styleCheck}
    alt="Screenshot of DOM with Spark Styles"/>
</div>

## Adding Angular Components

Now that everything is building,
let’s add a component to your
application that will allow us
to test that both Spark’s styles
and functionality are working.
We’ll use the
[Loading Button](https://angular.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--loading)
component to do this. You can
find code for all Spark
components at [angular.sparkdesignsystem.com](angular.sparkdesignsystem.com)

5. Copy the sample code inside `app.component.html`.

This file can be found in
`your-app/src/app`.
You can delete everything in this
file other than the final line (`<router-outlet></router-outlet>`) .

``` markup
<button
  (click)="checkSpinner($event)"
  sprkButton
>
  Button
</button>
```

You should now see a Spark Button in your
application! It might look slightly
cropped, but that’s OK. It’s
because we don’t yet have
any layout on the page.

6. Now let’s add some TypeScript
to trigger the Spinner
behavior. Copy this code into
the `AppComponent` class inside
`app.component.ts`. This file can
be found in `your-app/src/app`.

``` typescript
export class AppComponent {
  submitSpinning = false;

  checkSpinner(event): void {
    if (!this.submitSpinning) {
      setSpinning(event.target, {});
      this.submitSpinning = true;
    }
  }
}
```

7. Finally, import the `setSpinning`
utility function from the Spark
library. This goes at the top
of your component’s `.ts` file,
in our case `app.component.ts`.

``` typescript
import { setSpinning } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark';
```

8. Head back to your web browser and
click the Spark Button that you
added earlier. If everything's
working correctly, the text
should be replaced with an animated spinner.

## You did it!

You now have a development
environment set up with Spark
installed, and you’re ready
to start building!
