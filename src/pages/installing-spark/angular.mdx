# Angular Installation

This guide will walk you through installing
and using Spark on an existing Angular application.
For help with setting up the necessary
development environment, see the
[Angular CLI Overview](https://angular.io/cli).

This is a guide for installing Spark
and using Spark Angular components
on an existing Angular application.
You can find a guide for setting up
the necessary development
environment in the [Angular CLI Guide](https://angular.io/cli).
When setting up
your application, make sure to
include Angular Routing and
SCSS when prompted.

At the end of this guide you will have
all the Spark JavaScript and CSS
available in your application and
be ready to build with Spark components.

As of this writing, Angular 6, 7, and 8 are
supported. Spark does not officially support AngularJS.

## Before We Begin

This guide assumes:
 - you have a functioning Angular app
similar to the one created in the Angular CLI Guide.
- Sass is installed and functioning
(this is part of the Angular CLI Guide)
- Angular Routing is installed
(not required by this guide, but it is required by Spark)

You can download a repo
with these prerequisites
[here](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular).

## Installing Spark Packages

To begin, navigate to your project directory
and install `spark` and `spark-angular` by
pasting the following line in a
command line application.

``` bash
npm install -save-dev @sparkdesignsystem/spark @sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular
```

Edit `app.module.ts` to import the `spark-angular` library
as well as the `BrowserAnimationsModule`, and include
them in `@NgModule`'s `imports` array. This file can be
found in `your-app/src/app`.

``` typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { SparkAngularModule } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],

  imports: [
    SparkAngularModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],

  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

export class AppModule { }
```

Next, edit `styles.scss` to `@import` the Spark
stylesheet. This file can be found in `you-app/src`.

``` scss
@import "node_modules/@sparkdesignsystem/spark/spark.scss"
```

> Note: Importing Spark SCSS at the component level can lead to unexpected behavior.

Great! Back on the command line, let’s build
and run your new application by running
npm run start and opening `http://localhost:4200/`
in your web browser. When Angular builds,
Spark’s styles will be processed and
bundled into the application. The best
way to verify that this is working is to
add a Spark component, which we will do in
the next step. You can also verify that
Spark’s styles are being included by
opening your browser’s developer tools and
inspecting the DOM. There should be a
`<style>` tag in the `<head>` that
includes Spark’s styles.

## Navigating to Component Code Samples

Now that everything is building, let’s include
a Spark Button component in your application.

On [sparkdesignsystem.com](https://sparkdesignsystem.com),
we’ve documented all
the Spark components with copy/paste examples
for many variants and configurations you can
use in your application.

## Including Spark Angular Components in Your Application

Let's add a component to your
application that will allow us to
test that both Spark’s styles and
functionality are working. The Spinner
variant of the Button component is perfect for this.

First, copy the Spinner Button example
code inside `app.component.html`. This file
can be found in `your-app/src/app`. You can
delete everything in this file other
than the final line `(<router-outlet></router-outlet>)`

``` markup
<button
  (click)="checkSpinner($event)"
  sprkButton
>
  Button
</button>
```

You should now see a Spark Button
in your application! It’s ok
if it looks slightly cropped,
that’s just because we don’t have
any layout on the page.

Now let’s add some TypeScript
to trigger the Spinner
behavior. Copy this code into
the `AppComponent` class inside
`app.component.ts`. This file can
be found in `your-app/src/app`.

``` typescript
export class AppComponent {
  submitSpinning = false;

  checkSpinner(event): void {
    if (!this.submitSpinning) {
      setSpinning(event.target, {});
      this.submitSpinning = true;
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, import the `setSpinning`
utility function from the Spark
library. This goes at the top
of your component’s `.ts` file,
in our case `app.component.ts`.

``` typescript
import { setSpinning } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark';
```

Head back to your web browser and
click the Spark Button that you
added earlier. If everything is
working correctly, the text
should be replaced with an animated spinner.

## You did it!

You now have a development environment
with Spark installed and are ready to
start adding more Spark components.

environment, check out some of
