# Installing Spark in an Angular Project

This guide will walk you through
installing Spark on an
existing Angular application.

By the end of this guide, you'll have
Spark JavaScript and CSS available
in your application to start
building components.

> This guide covers setting up Spark for
Angular 7, 8 and 9. Spark doesn’t
currently support Angular JS.

Before you begin, make sure that:
 - You have a functioning Angular app similar
to the one in the [Angular CLI Overview](https://angular.io/cli)
- <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> is installed and functioning
- <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router" target="_blank">Angular Routing</a> is installed
(not required by Angular CLI, but it is required for Spark)

For help with setting up the
necessary development environment, see the
[Angular CLI Overview](https://angular.io/cli).

Our <a href="https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular/" target="_blank">starter app examples</a> are also available for reference:
- ['kitchen-sink' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular/tree/kitchen-sink) (Spark Installed with component examples.)
- ['without-spark' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular/tree/kitchen-sink) (All of the prerequisites before Spark Installation.)

## Installing Spark Packages

> Spark Angular also supports schematics. If you'd like to install Spark in this way, install Angular CDK if you haven't already (`npm install -g @angular/cdk`), and then run `ng add @sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular`.

1. Start by going to your project
directory and installing `spark-angular`.

``` bash
npm install @sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular --save-dev
```

2. In your `app.module.ts` file, do the following:
- Import the `spark-angular` library
- Import the `BrowserAnimationsModule`.
- Include both in `@NgModule`'s `imports` array.

``` typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { SparkAngularModule } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],

  imports: [
    SparkAngularModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],

  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

export class AppModule { }
```

3. In your `styles.scss` file, `@import` the Spark
stylesheet.

``` scss
@import "node_modules/@sparkdesignsystem/spark-styles/spark.scss"
```

> We recommend importing Spark Styles globally, because importing at the component level can lead to unexpected behavior.

4. In the project's `index.html` file, add the `sprk-u-JavaScript` CSS class to the root `<html>` element
in your application.

5. Build and run the application with
`npm run start`. When finished, the app will run on `http://localhost:4200/`
in your web browser.

You can verify that Spark’s
styles are being included by
opening your browser’s developer
tools and inspecting the DOM.
There should be a `<style>`
tag in the `<head>` that includes
Spark’s styles.

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    src={styleCheck}
    alt="Screenshot of DOM with Spark Styles"/>
</div>

## Adding Your First Spark Component
Adding a Spinner Button can confirm you've installed Spark Angular packages correctly.

This is just one example to implement functionality to get your project started.

1. In your `app.component.ts` file, do the following:
- Import `Component` and `HostListener` from `@angular/core`.
- Create `isAppLoading`, a variable we'll use to track state.
- Add a `HostListener` that will set `isAppLoading` to `true` on click.
``` javascript
import { Component, HostListener } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
  isAppLoading: boolean = false;

  @HostListener('click')
  onClick() {
    this.isAppLoading = true;
  }
}
```
1. In your `app.component.html` file, add a `<button>` element with a `sprkButton` directive.

This `<button>` will have:
- The `sprkButton` directive.
- An `isSpinning` input that is determined by the variable `isAppLoading`.
- Button content that will toggle between the Spark Spinner or Button text. This is determined by the variable `isAppLoading`.

``` html
<button
  sprkButton
  [isSpinning]="isAppLoading"
>
  <div
    sprkSpinner
    *ngIf="isAppLoading"
  >
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="!isAppLoading">
    Start Spinning
  </div>
</button>
```
Rebuild with `npm run start` and you should fine a Button that changes from text to a spinning state on click!

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={spinnergif}
    alt="A Spark Button Spinner component."/>
</div>

> Learn more about Spark Buttons and Spinner functionality in the [Button Storybook documentation](https://angular.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--primary).

## Finding the code to other Spark Components

1. Go to the [Spark Angular Storybook](https://angular.sparkdesignsystem.com/).
2. Find the Component you need in the "Components" section.
3. Navigate to the *Docs* tab. It's typically at the top of screen next to *Canvas*.
4. Navigate down the page until you find your component variant.
5. The *Show code* button will toggle a code sample.

> These code samples represent the final *rendered state* of the components. Just like with a Spark Button with a Spinner, some functionality requires additional engineering.

The *Docs* section of each page will give implementation details for each component.
