# Part 2: Installing Spark in an HTML Project
## Installing Spark

In this guide we’ll walk you through installing Spark into a site without a
JavaScript framework.

Our <a href="https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/" target="_blank">starter app examples</a> are also available for reference:
- ['kitchen-sink' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/tree/kitchen-sink) (Spark Installed with component examples.)
- ['without-spark' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/tree/without-spark) (All of the prerequisites before Spark Installation.)

For instructions on setting up Spark in other environments, check out the
guides for [Angular](/installing-spark/angular) and [React](/installing-spark/react) development environments.

## Install the Spark Package

1. First, use `npm` to install the Spark package. This will download the
JavaScript and CSS needed to add the Spark components.

``` shell
npm install --save-dev @sparkdesignsystem/spark
```

2. This will download all the JavaScript and CSS needed to render the Spark
components into your `node_modules` folder. To access
them in your compiled website, import them in your script. Webpack will
include them in your bundled site JavaScript. Copy this import code into your `index.js` file:
``` javascript
// import the Spark JavaScript
import spark from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/es5/spark";
import sparkPrerender from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/es5/sparkPrerender";

// optional (see below)
import "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/es5/sparkPolyfills";

// import the Spark CSS
import "@sparkdesignsystem/spark-styles/_spark.scss";

// initialize Spark
sparkPrerender();
spark();
```

> **sparkPolyfills** - This file loads a few polyfills that Spark requires. If your application is already polyfilling the items below, you don't need to load this file.
>
>- `Promise`
>- `Array.from`
>- `String.includes`
>- `Array.find`
>- `NodeList.forEach`
>- `classList` on SVG Elements

The Spark assets will now be included when you compile your site.
Run the following command:

``` shell
npm run build
```

You can verify that this is the case by checking the compiled `bundle.css` and
`main.js` in your solution. The compiled Spark CSS and JavaScript will show
here:

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={bundledSpark}
    alt="Minified CSS in bundle.css and minified JS in main.js"/>
</div>

## Configure Spark

3. Finally, in `index.html`, find or create the container of your main content and add the 
`data-sprk-main` attribute. This attribute is required for some
Spark components to correctly handle focus changes.

### Notes:
- Do not put `data-sprk-main` on the `<body>` tag.
- The main content container cannot contain the Spark Masthead component.
- Put this container above the `<script src="main.js"></script>` line.

``` html
<div data-sprk-main>
  // Main Content
</div>
```

your site.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some issues that you might encounter while setting up Spark and
how to fix them:

**Issue:**

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: SPRK_CURRENT_VERSION is not defined
```

Make sure you're importing Spark from the correct directory:

``` javascript
import spark from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/es5/spark";
```

This is not the correct directory:

``` javascript
import spark from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/spark";
```

---

**Issue: Spark.js is being called, but none of my components are being initialized.**

Make sure you're calling `spark()` *after* the DOM is loaded. You may need
to move the `<script>` tag in `index.html` to the bottom of the file.

---

**Issue: The Webpack build is completing without errors but Spark JS and
CSS are not being applied to my site.**

Make sure you're referencing your JavaScript and CSS files correctly in 
`index.html`. In our example, we needed to change the import from 
`src/index.js` to `main.js`.
