# Installing Spark in a React Project

This guide walks you through installing and using Spark on an existing
React app.

For help with setting up the necessary development environment,
see the [React App Getting Started Guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

By the end of this guide, you’ll have Spark set up on your project and have access to all of our components.

-----------

Our <a href="https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react/" target="_blank">starter app examples</a> are available for reference:
- ['kitchen-sink' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react/tree/kitchen-sink) (Spark Installed with component examples.)
- ['without-spark' branch](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react/tree/kitchen-sink) (All of the prerequisites before Spark Installation.)


## Installing Sass
<a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> is a tool that processes and compiles CSS. You’ll need to use Sass
to import Spark styles into your site.

1. Run this command to install Sass:
```
npm install node-sass --save-dev
```
2. Rename `App.css` to `App.scss`
3. In `App.js`, update the import line to point at the new filename.
``` javascript
import './App.scss'
```
4. Create a new file in `src` called `styles.scss` and copy this CSS into it:
``` css
body {
  border: 50px solid pink;
}
```
5. In `App.scss`, import this new file:
``` javascript
@import './styles.scss';
```

If your React server has stopped, restart it now and view your compiled
React site. You should see the new CSS you’ve written included in the
site, along with the original React CSS:


<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={reactApp}
    alt="Screenshot of Create React App running in a browser."/>
</div>

## Install Spark Packages
Now we’ll use Sass to import all the Spark CSS.

1. Install the Spark React package. It contains all of the Spark React components and Sass styles needed to build with spark.
```
npm install @sparkdesignsystem/spark-react --save-dev
```
2. Import the Spark Sass file into the main Sass file (e.g., `App.scss`).
``` javascript
@import "../node_modules/@sparkdesignsystem/spark-styles/spark.scss";
```
When you build and run your website, all the Spark CSS will now be bundled
into your output. You can verify this by inspecting your site’s DOM and
looking for the Spark CSS. There should be a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`
of your page that includes Spark’s styles.
<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={styleCheck}
    alt="Screenshot of DOM with Spark Styles"/>
</div>
If Spark React is installed correctly, you should see these CSS rules
listed in your page’s code.

## Adding Your First Spark Component
Adding a Spinner Button can confirm you've installed Spark React packages correctly.

This is just one example to implement functionality to get your project started.

Rewrite `App.js` to into a [class component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) and prepare `SprkButton` to render a `SprkSpinner` on click.

The following code sample has:
- An import of the React package.
- A reference to your `App.scss` file.
- An import of `SprkButton` and `SprkSpinner`.
- State that will handle the status of `isSpinning`, and render the `SprkSpinner` when `true` (for this example, we'll name it `isAppLoading`).
- `SprkButton` that sets `isAppLoading` to `true` after clicking.
- Logic inside of `SprkButton` that renders the `SprkSpinner` according to `isAppLoading` state.

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.scss';
import { SprkButton, SprkSpinner } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark-react';

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isAppLoading: false};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <SprkButton
        isSpinning={this.state.isAppLoading}
        onClick={() => { this.setState({ isAppLoading: true }) }}
      >
        {this.state.isAppLoading ? <SprkSpinner /> :'Start Spinning'}
      </SprkButton>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
Now, when you click a button, the SprkButton should change from text to a spinning state!

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={spinnergif}
    alt="Screenshot of React App with Spark Spark Button"/>
</div>

> Learn more about `SprkButton` and `SprkSpinner` functionality in the [Button Storybook documentation](https://react.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--primary).


## Finding the code to other Spark Components

1. Go to the [Spark React Storybook](https://react.sparkdesignsystem.com/).
2. Find the Component you need in the "Components" section.
3. Navigate to the *Docs* tab. It's typically at the top of screen next to *Canvas*.
4. Navigate down the page until you find your component variant.
5. The *Show code* button will toggle a code sample.

> These code samples represent the final *rendered state* of the components. Just like with a `SprkButton` with a spinner, some functionality requires additional engineering.

The *Docs* section of each page will give implementation details for each component.
