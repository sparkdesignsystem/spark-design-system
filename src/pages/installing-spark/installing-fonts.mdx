# Getting Started with Spark Fonts

As part of Spark, our design system includes functionality
for applying web fonts. It allows you to configure your font
setup using Sass variables which will be included in the
Spark CSS bundle when you build your site.

## Configuring Sass Variables

There are unique Sass variables that allow you to
configure Spark fonts for your build. Refer to the
descriptions to learn what they are.

**Note:** They must be set in your Sass before importing Spark.

| Sass Variable | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `$sprk-using-webfonts` | boolean | Informs Spark that webfonts will be applied. **Note:** Change default setting from `false` to `true` to use Spark webfonts. |
| `$sprk-font-display` | **(Optional)** string | Controls behavior of the text while fonts are being loaded. **Note:** Default value is `swap` which will cause text to render using a fallback font until the custom font is available. Correct font is `swap`ped in. Information on the `font-display` property and values are found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display). |
| `$sprk-webfonts` | Sass List | Expects a Sass List containing one or more nested Sass Lists. **Note:** The nested lists should contain the font’s URL, name and weight. It does require a series of font declarations. |

A full valid `$sprk-webfonts` object example looks something like this:

```javascript
$sprk-using-webfonts: true;
$sprk-webfonts:
(
  (
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Bold.woff2') format('woff2'),
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Bold.woff') format('woff')
  ),
  MyFont, 700
),
(
  (
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Medium.woff2') format('woff2'),
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Medium.woff') format('woff')
  ),
  MyFont, 500
),
(
  (
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Regular.woff') format('woff')
  ),
  MyFont, 400
),
(
  (
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Light.woff2') format('woff2'),
    url('https://www.example.com/MyFont-Light.woff') format('woff')
  ),
  MyFont, 300
);
```

### Troubleshooting

* Rocket products must include the font name, **RocketSans**. Remove all references of **MyFont**.
* Include all four font weights - 300, 400, 500, and 700 - within your build for the fonts to work properly.
