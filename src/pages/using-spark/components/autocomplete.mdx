# Autocomplete

Autocomplete input fields allow the browser to predict information being
entered by the user. The browser should display options based on
previous information entered.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-story"
  hasHTML
  hasAngular
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Usage

Autocomplete helps users search for options that are difficult to remember or
commonly misspelled. They allow designers to include more options to choose
from, with less space.

### Guidelines

Autocomplete input fields should be used:

- When information can be predicted from previously entered information.
- When accuracy and speed are important to the user.
- When the number of options is no longer convenient or efficient to display
  in a select box.
- When a select box has too many options but can be predicted for the user
  (i.e. states, countries).

Best practices for Autocomplete input fields:

- Try to keep lists under 10 matching options so the user doesn't have to
  scroll.
- Guide the user by highlighting the most relevant suggestion.
- Use text wrapping for longer suggestions.
- Order suggestions by relevancy for quick selection.
- Ensure the Autocomplete list is not blocking other elements on mobile.

Autocomplete is commonly used for search bars where accurate, quick suggestions
help the user choose the correct data format for a task.

## Variants

### Default

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-story"
  hasHTML
  hasAngular
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Huge

Huge Autocomplete is a larger version of the Autocomplete field.

They're commonly used as a standalone feature on the page.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--huge-story"
  hasHTML
  hasAngular
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

## States

Each Autocomplete variant has an error and disabled state.

### Error

<ComponentPreview componentName="autocomplete--default-invalid" hasHTML />

### Disabled

<ComponentPreview componentName="autocomplete--default-disabled" hasHTML />

### Active Typing

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={typingExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="As a user types into the Autocomplete input, matching results are displayed in a listbox below the input."/>

### Selecting Option

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={selectingExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="The Autocomplete component with a mouse cursor highlighting a search result."/>

### No Results Found

Provide guidance and offer suggestions if no results are found or do not match any information in the database.

Create a better experience for the user by:

- Expressing empathy.
- Clearly communicate the state of the result.
- Offer suggestions for next steps.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={noResultsFoundExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="The Autocomplete component displaying a 'No results found' message."/>

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"></SprkDivider>

## Additional Customizations

### No Search Icon

Showing a search icon is not required if an Autocomplete is part of a larger form.

Use the search icon when an Autocomplete is independent of other form elements on the page to provide clarity that this is a search field.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={noSearchIconExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="The Autocomplete component without the search icon."/>

### Address - Two Lines of Text

Addresses can span two lines when displaying the full address.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={twoLinesExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="The Autocomplete component displaying multi-line search results."/>

### No Label

A label is not required for this input type. Autocomplete inputs should not use a label when used in a masthead.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={noLabelExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="The Autocomplete component depicted without the label."/>

### Search Across Categories

If there are different types of results for the same search term that users may need to look, then the categories can be featured at the top of the list for users to choose.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={categoriesExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="The Autocomplete component displaying category links at the top of the search results."/>

### Focused - Without Search

Use a focused state when users have recently interacted with the Autocomplete input. By including terms they have searched in the past, we can help navigate to results quicker.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={recentSearchesExample}
  style="max-width: 40rem; width: 100%;"
  alt="The Autocomplete displaying a Recent Searches list."/>

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"></SprkDivider>

## Research

The Autocomplete pattern is based on the principle of recognition over recall.
