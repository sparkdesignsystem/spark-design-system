# Stack

Stack is a responsive layout object
that allows you to stack content
blocks in a single vertical column
and split them into multiple columns
at wider viewports.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Stack Example"
/>

### Usage

It is often desirable for blocks of content
to be laid out in a single column on narrow
viewports, but multiple side-by-side
columns on wider viewports.
The Stack component can be used
to control these kinds of layout
changes between viewport sizes.

Stack can be used for both
page-level and component-level
layout. For example, you can use
Stack to create a two-column page
layout or within a component to
make two buttons stack at narrow
viewports and split next to each
other on wider viewports.

### Guidelines

- Stack objects can be nested inside other Stack objects.
- Stack Items can split into side-by-side columns at the following breakpoints:
  - XX Small (xxs) – `320px`
  - Extra Small (xs) – `480px`
  - Small (s) - `680px`
  - Medium (m) – `880px`
  - Large (l) – `1080px`
  - Extra Large (xl) – `1280px`
- Stack can reverse the direction of the
Spark Item elements. This only works when
using the split-reverse modifier and can’t
be used with a single column Stack.
- Spacing between Stack Items can be set using
the available [Spacing](/using-spark/foundations/space) sizes.
  - Tiny - `4px`
  - Small - `8px`
  - Medium - `16px`
  - Large - `32px`
  - Huge - `64px`
- All Stack Items inside a Stack must add
up to 100% width or the layout will not work.
For example, if you have a Stack Item
set to 1/2 width you can have one more
Stack Item at 1/2 width, two more
at 1/4 width each, etc.
- Stack Items don’t have any internal
padding. To add padding, consider using the [Box Object.](/using-spark/components/box)

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Default

By default, Stack Items will form a single vertical column.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Default Stack Example"
/>

### Stack with Space Between Items

Space can be added between Stack Items.
By default the spacing is below each item.
When the items are split, the spacing is
on the right. The available sizes are
tiny, small, medium, large, and huge.
The example shows medium spacing and
splits at the small breakpoint (“s”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with Two Columns

This layout configuration splits
into two columns at a set
breakpoint. The example
shows the split at extra
small breakpoint (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-two-col"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Two Column Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with Three Columns

This layout configuration splits into
three columns at a set breakpoint.
The example shows the split at
extra small breakpoint (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-three-col"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Three Column Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with Four Columns

This layout configuration splits
into four columns at a set breakpoint.
The example shows the split at extra
small breakpoint (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-four-col"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Four Column Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with Five Columns

This layout configuration splits
into five columns at a set breakpoint.
The example shows the split at
extra small breakpoint (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-five-col"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Five Column Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with Six Columns

This layout configuration splits into
six columns at a set breakpoint. The
example shows the split at extra
small breakpoint (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-six-col"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Six Column Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with 75/25 Columns

This layout configuration splits into
two columns at a set breakpoint. One
column takes up 75% and the other
takes up 25% of the available width.
The example shows the split at extra small (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-layout-three-fourths"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="75/25 Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with 60/40 Columns

This layout configuration splits into
two columns at a set breakpoint.
One column takes up 60% and the
other takes up 40% of the
available width. The example
shows the split at extra small (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-layout-three-fifths"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="60/40 Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with 70/30 Columns

This layout configuration splits
into two columns at a set breakpoint.
One column takes up 70% and the
other takes up 30% of the available
width. The example shows the split
at extra small (“xs”).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-layout-three-tenths"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="70/30 Split Stack Example"
/>

### Split Stack with Mixed and Nested Columns

This layout configuration shows many
combinations in which Stack can be
used. It’s flexibility shows that
Stack objects can be nested inside
of each other and even contain
flexbox elements meant to fill
in the remaining space.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stack--stack-split-layout-mixed"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Split Stack Example with Mixed and Nested Columns"
/>

## Anatomy

- Stack must have a container to wrap Stack Items.
This container dictates spacing between items and split breakpoints.
- Stack Items must be inside the Stack container.
All Stack Item sizes must add up to 100% in total width.

## Accessibility

- Reversing the direction Stack splits
could affect the order a screen reader
will read the content. This can vary
depending on device and browser
context. Please use with caution.
