# Highlight Board

The Highlight Board component is a prominent
way to introduce an experience and present
the user with a clear call to action.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="highlight-board--default-story"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Highlight Board Example"
/>

### Usage

Highlight Board is typically used at
the top of a page, below the Masthead.
It can also be used as a call to action
on other parts of a page.

### Guidelines

- Effective use of a Highlight Board involves
a clear, concise headline that grabs attention.
- The background can either be an image or a solid color.
- The headline should not exceed 2-3 lines.
- The background image can either take up the full width
of the site’s main container or extend to the full width
of the viewport.
- If there is only one call-to-action, it must use the primary button style.
- A secondary call-to-action must exist with a primary call-to-action.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Default

The Default Highlight Board is used to encourage engagement
with strong imagery or a solid background color.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="highlight-board--default-story"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Default Highlight Board Example"
/>

### No Image

The No Image Highlight Board omits the background
image and centers the content.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="highlight-board--no-image"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="No Image Highlight Board Example"
/>

### Stacked

The Stacked Highlight Board places the image,
content, and buttons in a vertical stack.
This places greater emphasis on the image.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="highlight-board--stacked"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Stacked Highlight Board Example"
/>

## Anatomy

- Highlight Board must contain a headline.
- Highlight Board should include one or more buttons.
- Highlight Board may have either a background image,
a solid background color, or no image.

## Accessibility

- When using a Highlight Board that includes an image,
be sure to include a descriptive `alt` attribute.
- When using a solid background color, the contrast ratio
between the headline and the background must be at least 3:1.
- To check the contrast ratio of your text on a background image,
check out [this resource](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
Use a color picker tool to test the background colors of the image
against the test color.
