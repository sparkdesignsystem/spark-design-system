# Dropdown

Dropdown provides multiple choices
that cause an action when selected.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="dropdown--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  minHeight="15rem"
  titleAttr="Dropdown Example"
/>

### Usage

A Dropdown displays a list of contextual options,
triggered by an interaction with another element
(like an Icon or Button). Once a selection is made,
some action will occur (e.g. navigate to another page).

### Guidelines

- Dropdown is not the same as the HTML
Select element and should not be used in a form.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Base

Base Dropdown is primarily used as a context menu.
For example, when the user clicks on the user
icon in the Masthead, it opens a Base Dropdown
with links to account settings.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="dropdown--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  minHeight="15rem"
  titleAttr="Base Dropdown Example"
/>

### Informational

Informational Dropdown is an expanded version
of the Base Dropdown. Each choice has a title
and additional information. Additionally, it
has an optional secondary action.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="dropdown--informational"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
  titleAttr="Informational Dropdown Example"
/>

## Anatomy

- Dropdown must have an element to trigger
the Dropdown (e.g. a Button or Icon).
- Dropdown must have a list of choices.
- Dropdown may have a title above the list
of choices.
- Informational Dropdown must have additional
information about each choice.
- Informational Dropdown may have a secondary
action at the bottom (e.g. a Link or Button).
