  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Default Text Input Example"
/>

### Usage

Usage for Input depends on the Input type.
Please see the Usage and Guidelines for each
Input type. Take care to choose the appropriate
Input type for your use case.

### Guidelines

- Labels and error messages should be short,
instructional, and to the point.
- Labels should be kept to one line.
- If an Input needs more information than can
be provided in the label, use Helper Text.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## States

Each input has an error and disabled state.

<a id="checkbox" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Checkbox
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Checkbox allows a user to choose more
than one option from a list.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-checkbox--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Checkbox Example"
/>

### Huge Checkbox
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Huge checkboxes allow a user to select one or more options from a list.

The Huge Checkbox component is intended for flows
that present single questions in a step by step process.
For this reason, Huge Checkbox should only be
used for stand-alone question flows.

#### Guidelines
- Ensure list is in logical order for inputs (groups will stack).
- Options should be short and concise. Content should not exceed 40 characters.
- If a concise label is not enough information for the user to make a reasonable choice, consider using a [tooltip](https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-tooltip--default-story) to provide more context.
- There should be at least two options, but no more than six.
- To see layout configurations with two, three, four, five, or six options, see the [Storybook page](https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-input-checkbox--huge).
- This component cannot have more than six options. If your design needs more, consider using a [Huge Select Box](#huge-select-box) instead.

#### Anatomy
- A question related to the group of options.
- A list of two to six options, each with a concise label, all the same size.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-checkbox--huge"

<a id="date-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Date Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Date Input is used for collecting a well-known date
(e.g. birthdate) or a date in the far future or
past (i.e. when did you move?). It does not include
a date picker.
- Additional engineering is required to reformat
user input into a date pattern (MM/DD/YYYY).
- After valid input, it should reformat to a two
digit number month, followed by a forward slash,
two digit number day, followed by another forward
slash, and four digit number year.
- Additional engineering is required for validation
functionality.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-date--date-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Date Input Example"
/>

<a id="date-picker" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Date Picker
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Date Picker is used for collecting a date around one
year before or after the current date. We restrict
the distance from the current date because it is more
difficult for a user to find the date they need when
they must page through dozens of months.
- Additional engineering is required to reformat user
input into a date pattern (MM/DD/YYYY).
- After valid input, it should reformat to a two digit
number month, followed by a forward slash, two digit
number day, followed by another forward slash, and
four digit number year.
- Additional engineering is required for
validation functionality.

<a id="helper-text" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Helper Text
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Helper Text provides additional guidance that helps
the user understand what information the input requires.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-helper-text--helper-text"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Helper Text Example"
/>

<a id="text-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor" />

### Text Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

A Text Input allows users to enter and edit
text. It is the most common Input type.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Text Input Example"
/>

<a id="huge-text-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor" />

### Huge Text Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Huge Text Input is a larger version of Text
Input. The label is inside the Input instead
of above it. On focus, the label animates to
the top left of the Input and placeholder
text takes its place.

Huge Text Input was designed for a multi-step
form flow that presents a single Input per page.
For this reason, Huge Text Input should only be
used for stand-alone Inputs. An exception would
be a set of fields that are typically together,
like an address.

#### Guidelines

- Labels must be short enough to fit inside the
Input and cannot wrap to a second line.
- The following Inputs are currently able to use
the Huge Text Input style:
  - SSN Input
  - Password Input
  - Phone Number Input
  - Date Input
  - Date Picker

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--huge-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Huge Text Input Example"
/>

<a id="monetary-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Monetary Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Monetary Input is used to collect a value in US dollars.
- This field is automatically formatted to include commas,
a decimal, and 2 zeros (If no decimal is entered) when focus
is removed from the field (e.g. 1,000.00).
- Additional engineering is required to reformat user
input into a monetary pattern (##.##)
  - After valid input, it should reformat to add commas
  and decimals to the hundredth place.
- Additional engineering is required for validation functionality.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-monetary--monetary-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Monetary Input Example"
/>

<a id="password-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Password Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Password Input is used for collecting a password.
- The value is masked by default.
- Checking "Show Password" removes the mask and
shows the entered value.
- Password Input can also be a Huge Text Input.
For full functionality, see guidelines in the
[Huge Text Inputs](#huge-text-input) section.

<a id="phone-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Phone Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Phone Input is used to collect a phone number.
- Additional engineering is required to reformat user
input into a phone number pattern (###) ###-####.
  - After valid input, it should reformat to have
  the area code surrounded by parenthesis, a space
  before the next three digits, and a dash before
  the next four digits.
- Additional engineering is required for validation functionality.
- Phone Input can also be a Huge Text Input. For full
functionality, see guidelines in the Text Huge Inputs section.

<a id="radio-button" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Radio Button
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Radio buttons present a list of valid options.
Each option allows the user to select one
option at a time. Radio buttons are mutually
exclusive, meaning if one radio button is
selected the other is deselected.

#### Guidelines

- If the list of choices becomes too large,
consider using a Select Box instead.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-radio--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Radio Button Example"
/>

<a id="huge-radio-button" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Huge Radio Button
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Huge radio buttons present a list of valid options that are mutually exclusive. Only one can be selected at a time for any given question.

The Huge radio component is intended for flows
that present single questions in a step by step process.
For this reason, Huge Checkbox should only be
used for stand-alone question flows.

#### Guidelines
- Ensure list is in logical order for inputs (groups will stack).
- Options should be short and concise. Content should not exceed 40 characters.
- If a concise label is not enough information for the user to make a reasonable choice, consider using a [tooltip](https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-tooltip--default-story) to provide more context.
- There should be at least two options, but no more than six.
- To see layout configurations with two, three, four, five, or six options, see the [Storybook page](https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-input-radio--huge).
- This component cannot have more than six options. If your design needs more, consider using a [Huge Select Box](#huge-select-box) instead.

#### Anatomy
- A question related to the group of options.
- A list of two to six options, each with a concise label, all the same size.

<a id="search-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Search Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Search Input allows a user to make a search query.

  componentName="input-search--search-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Search Input Example"
/>

<a id="select-box" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Select Box
[Back to Variants](#variants)

Allows a user to select one choice from a set of options.

#### Guidelines

- If there are only a few options in the set,
consider using Radio Button.
- Select Box is not the same as the Dropdown
component.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-select--select-box"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Select Box Input Example"
/>

<a id="huge-select-box" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### Huge Select Box
[Back to Variants](#variants)

This is a larger version of the Select Box,
consistent with the style of Huge Text Input.
The label is shown inside the select. On focus,
the label animates to the top left.

Like Huge Text Input, Huge Select was designed
for a multi-step form flow that presents a single
Input per page. For this reason, Huge Select Box
should only be used for stand-alone Inputs.

#### Guidelines

- Labels must be short enough to fit inside the
Input and cannot wrap to a second line.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-select--huge-select-box"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Huge Select Example"
/>

<a id="ssn-input" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"/>

### SSN Input
[Back to Variants](#variants)

SSN Input is used to collect a Social
Security Number.
- Checking "Show SSN" removes the mask
and shows the entered value.
- If “Show SSN” is checked, this field is
automatically formatted to ###-##-####
once a valid value is entered.
- SSN Input can also be a Huge Text Input.
For full functionality, see guidelines in
the Huge Text Inputs section.
- Additional engineering is required to
reformat user input into an SSN pattern
(###-##-####)
  - After valid input, it should reformat
  to having the first three numbers, a dash,
  the next two numbers, a dash, and the last
  four numbers.
- Additional engineering is required for
validation functionality.
