# Stepper

Stepper displays a series of sequential steps
with optional descriptions and images.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stepper--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Stepper Example"
/>

### Usage

The Stepper is useful for displaying a high-level
breakdown of a sequential process. Users can manually
move between steps to access the related descriptions and images.

### Guidelines

- Stepper must have a minimum of two items.
- Only one step can be selected at a time.
- Stepper should *not* be used as a progress indicator.
There is currently no built-in way to mark a step as
"completed".

## Variants

### Default

The Default Stepper is a series of steps with titles.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stepper--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Default Stepper Example"
/>

### With Step Descriptions

Each step can have an associated text description
that is visible when the step is selected.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stepper--with-step-descriptions"
  hasReact
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Stepper with Step Descriptions Example"
/>

### With Dark Background

If Stepper is on a dark background, the
font colors will be inverted for better legibility.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stepper--with-dark-background"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  titleAttr="Stepper with Dark Background Example"
/>

### With Carousel

In addition to descriptions, each step can have an
associated image that is displayed in a carousel.
The carousel rotates so that the image associated
with the active step is always visible.

On small screens, the image will stack on top of a
row of step indicators followed by the step heading
and description.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="stepper--with-carousel"
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Stepper with Carousel Example"
/>
