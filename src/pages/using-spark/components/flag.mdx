# Flag

The Flag object is a simple abstraction that displays an
image or other media next to descriptive content.
The concept comes from the
[Nicole Sullivan’s Media Object](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)
and was updated to allow vertical
alignment and renamed the
[Flag Object by Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/2013/05/the-flag-object/).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="flag--default-story"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  titleAttr="Flag Example"
/>

### Usage

The Flag object is a simple concept but can
be used any time there is an image or other
media next to descriptive content.

### Guidelines

- The media can be on the left or right of the content area.
- The content area can be vertically aligned
to the top, middle, or the bottom of the media.
- There are no restrictions on the content
that can be put in the content area.
- The Flag object can be nested inside another Flag object.
- The spacing between the media and the content
area can be set to any Spacing value.
- On small viewports, the content area
can be configured to move below the media.

### Reverse Modifier
This modifier rearranges elements of the flag so the media is to the right of the content area.
#### Accessibility
Tabbing and screen readers are based on DOM order. Keep in mind that this reverse modifier is purely a visual change, not a DOM change. With more complex layouts, be mindful that visual and DOM order misatches will affect keyboard, magnifier, and screen reader users.
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="flag--reversed"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  titleAttr="Reversed Flag Example"
/>

### Stacked Modifier
This modifier rearranges elements to stack on top of each other based on a breakpoint.
This can be used in conjunction with reverse, but the stacking will always have the media element above the body content.
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="flag--stacked"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  titleAttr="Stacked Flag Example"
/>

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- A Flag object must have a fixed image or other media.
- A Flag object must have a flexible content area.
