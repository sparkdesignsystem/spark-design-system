# Promo

Promo is a brief message and call to action
intended to draw attention to promoted or
related content.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="promo--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Promo Example"
/>

### Usage

Use Promo to draw attention to promoted or
related content, e.g. to link a refinance
calculator in an article on the refinance process.

### Guidelines

- The text content of Promo should be kept concise.
- Keep the length of the title and subtitle to one line each.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Default

The default Promo contains text and a call to action.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="promo--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Default Promo Example"
/>

### Flag

The Flag variant displays text near a small image.
This variant is useful when you want to incorporate
an image while keeping the greatest emphasis on the text.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="promo--flag"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Flag Promo Example"
/>

### With Image

The Image variant includes an image that takes up
half the width of the Promo. This is useful when
you want to include an image with equal prominence to the text.

To preserve the aspect ratio of Promo, the image height
will stay consistent with the height of the text content area.
If there isn’t room for the full width of the image it will be
cut off on the sides without distorting the image.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="promo--with-image"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Promo with Image Example"
/>

### With Image (Reversed)

Identical to the With Image variant with the image
on the opposite side.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="promo--with-reversed-image"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Promo with Image (Reversed) Example"
/>
