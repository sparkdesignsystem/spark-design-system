# Accordion

An Accordion is a simple way of showing,
hiding and breaking down content. It
should be used when a large group
of related content needs to be
separated into smaller, digestible
chunks. An Accordion consists of a
series of Toggle components.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="accordion--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Usage
An Accordion should be used when
content needs to be broken down,
but is still important enough to
be of primary interest on the page.
This Accordion's design is used to
give it some visual weight
within the design and make it
apparent that the content is important.

## Guidelines
- Content length inside the Accordion does not have a limit.
- Title content of the Accordion can wrap, but it is recommended
  that it is short and to the point.
