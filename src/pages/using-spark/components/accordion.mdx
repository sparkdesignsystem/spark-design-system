# Accordion

Accordion holds sections that hide or reveal related information.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="accordion--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Use Accordion to separate supplementary (lower-priority) content into digestible pieces.

### Guidelines

- Adding this as a test.
- Accordion sections are collapsed by default. Because this hides content, only use this to augment information already on the page. Avoid high-priority content.
- Avoid adding complex interactions like forms, buttons, and dropdowns. They complicate the user's experience.
- Do not put an Accordion inside of another Accordion.
- Keep Accordion titles succinct, clear, and short enough to be in one line.
- Accordion titles should be relevant to the content it reveals. A user should know exactly what to expect when they expand a section.
- If your Accordion only has one item, use the [Toggle Component](https://sparkdesignsystem.com/using-spark/components/toggle) instead.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- An Accordion Item must have a clickable header that reveals or hides information.
- An Accordion Item must have a left aligned title.
- An Accordion Item must contain content.
- An Accordion Item must have a right aligned \`chevron-up-circle\` or \`chevron-down-circle\` Icon

## Accessibility

- Accessible through keyboard.
  - `Tab` and `Shift` + `Tab` keys navigate through Accordion item headings.
  - `Enter` and `Space` keys expands or collapses each section.
