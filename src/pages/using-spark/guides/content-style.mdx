## Capitalization

Use for visual presentation of pieces of text to make it easy for users to read.

> As a general rule, use **start case** for **headers**, use either **start case** or **sentence case** for **drop down options** and **labels**, depending on the context.

### Start Case

Capitalize the first letter of each word, regardless of length or part of speech. When using start case, avoid using end punctuation other than question marks.
