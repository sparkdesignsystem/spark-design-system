# Design Tokens

Spark provides design tokens that store our design decisions.
These tokens can be retrieved in different formats for different devices.
These variables provide global settings for components in the system.
For web, almost every aspect of each Spark component is
configurable with a Sass variable.

** Override the Sass settings by: **
1. Creating a new Sass file.
2. Importing it before Spark's main Sass file.
3. Assigning a new value to the variable you want to override.

> These make global changes to your project. Changing a variable affects all instances of its relevant components. For one-off modifications, use [CSS utilities](/using-spark/foundations/css-utilities).
