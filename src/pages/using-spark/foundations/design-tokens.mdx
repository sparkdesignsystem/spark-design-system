Our Design Tokens are a catalog from which we base all our visual and branding choices.
It's a central database of our core style attributes.

These tokens describe branding decisions in color, typography, spacing, sizing, and much more.

Design Tokens are a future-friendly way to create visual consistency between platforms.

## Benefits

 For Designers
</h3>

Use token names to communicate the specific style values of your design.

Token names depict style choices that portray color, spacing, typography, and more.

For example, the token `sprk-purple-deep` represents a specific shade of purple. Style consensus makes it clear to everyone which purple you mean.
