          Spark-Core contains the basic patterns and components that make up the visual and interaction
          design of the Quicken Loans family of Fintech products. If your application is expected
          to look and behave like a Quicken Loans application, this package is the starting point.
          When the Spark-Core Sass and JS setup files are imported into an application you will receive
          code for all of Spark-Core.

        <p class="drizzle-b-P">
          Spark-Extras are components that may not be needed by all applications,
          but are consistent with the style of Spark Core.
          Spark-Extras Sass and JS are imported into an application on an individual basis.
          You import the components that you need.
