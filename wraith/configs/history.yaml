# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.
# Feel free to amend for your own requirements.

# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'history' mode, which is best suited to
# making sure your site's appearance remains consistent over
# time.
#
# `wraith history history.yaml` # generate base screenshots
# `wraith latest history.yaml`  # take new shots and compare

# (required) The engine to run Wraith with. Examples: 'phantomjs', 'casperjs', 'slimerjs'
browser: "casperjs"

# (required) The domain to take screenshots of.
domains:
  english: "http://www.bbc.co.uk"

# (required) The paths to capture. This particular config is using casperjs, so we can take screenshots of selectors rather than the entire page.
paths:
  clickable_guide:
    path: /news/entertainment-arts-27221191
    selector: '.idt__news' # (optional) selector to take a screenshot of
  clickable_guide__after_click:
    path: /news/entertainment-arts-27221191
    selector: '.idt__news'
    before_capture: 'javascript/interact--casper.js' # (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking the screenshot of this path.

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
before_capture: 'javascript/wait--casper.js'

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
screen_widths:
  - 320
  - 600x768
  - 768
  - 1024
  - 1280

# (optional) Resize to each screen width (efficient), or reload at each screen width (costly). Default: 'reload'

# (required for history mode, otherwise optional) The directory that your base screenshots will be stored in.
history_dir: 'shots_base'

# (required) The directory that your latest screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'shots'

# (required) Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.
fuzz: '20%'

# (optional) The maximum acceptable level of difference (in %) between two images before Wraith reports a failure. Default: 0
threshold: 5

# (optional) Specify the template (and generated thumbnail sizes) for the gallery output.

  thumb_width:  200
  thumb_height: 200

# (optional) Choose which results are displayed in the gallery, and in what order. Default: alphanumeric
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
mode: diffs_first

# (optional) Choose to run Wraith in verbose mode, for easier debugging. Default: false
